# Oregon-Highway-Simplification
This repository illustrates the simplification of geojson polyline features using [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/). Reductions to file size are shown in the table below. The example geojson is a polyline of Oregon Route 36, which is a state highway that travels east-west from the Willamette Valley near Eugene to the Oregon Coast at Florence.
